pyGTKtalog 1.0 RC2
==================

pyGTKtalog is Linux/FreeBSD program for indexing CD/DVD or directories on
filesystem. It is similar to gtktalog <http://www.nongnu.org/gtktalog/> or
gwhere <http://www.gwhere.org/home.php3>. There is no coincidence in name of
application, because it's ment to be replacement (in some way) for gtktalog,
which seems to be dead project for years.

FEATURES
========

- scan for files in selected media
- get/generate thumbnails from exif and other images
- most important exif tags
- add/edit description and notes
- fetch comments for images made in gThumb <http://gthumb.sourceforge.net>
- add/remove unlimited images to any file or directory
- tagging files <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_%28metadata%29>
- and more :)

REQUIREMENTS
============

pyGTKtalog is written in python with following dependencies:

- python 2.4 or higher
- pygtk 2.10 or higher <http://www.pygtk.org>
- pysqlite2 <http://pysqlite.org/> (unnecessary, if python 2.5 is used)

Optional modules:

- PIL <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm> for image manipulation

Additional pyGTKtalog uses pygtkmvc <http://pygtkmvc.sourceforge.net> by Roberto
Cavada and EXIF module by Gene Cash (slightly updatetd to EXIF 2.2 by me) which
are included in sources.

pyGTKtalog extensivly uses external programs in unix spirit, however there is
small possibility of using it Windows (probably with limitations) and quite big
possiblity to run it on other sofisticated unix-like systems (i.e.
BeOS/ZETA/Haiku, QNX or MacOSX).

INSTALATION
===========

You don't have to install it if you don't want to. You can just change current
directory to pyGTKtalog and simply run:

./pyGTKtalog

That's it. Alternatively, if you like to put it in more system wide place, all
you have to do is:

- put pyGTKtalog directory into your destination of choice (/usr/local/share,
  /opt or ~/ is typical bet)
- copy pyGTKtalog shell script to /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin or in
  other place, where PATH variable is pointing or you feel like.
- then modify pyGTKtalog line 6 to match right pygtktalog.py directory

Then, just run pyGTKtalog script.
  
TODO
====

PyGTKtalog is still under heavy development, however there is small chance to
change structure of catalogs (and if it'll change, there will be transparent
function to update DB schema).

For version 1.0 there are no features to be done, just bug fixes.

There are still minor aims for versions 1.x to be done:
- consolidate popup-menus with edit menu
- add popup menu for directly removing tag from tag cloud
- implement advanced search

For version 2.0:
- Icon grid in files view
- command line support: query, adding media to collection etc
- internationalization
- export to XLS
- user definied group of tags (represented by color in cloud tag)
- hiding specified files - configurable, like dot prefixed, cfg and manualy
  selected

Removed:
- filetypes handling (movies, images, archives, documents etc). Now it have
  common, unified external "plugin" system - simple text output from command
  line programs.
- anime/movie
		- title
		- alt title
		- type (anime movie, movie, anime oav, anime tv series, tv series, etc)
		- cover/images
		- genre
		- lang
		- sub lang
		- release date (from - to)
		- anidb link/imdb link
  Maybe in future versions. Now text file descriptions/notes and tags have to
  be enough for good and fast information search.

NOTES
=====

Catalog file is tared and gziped sqlite database and directories with images and
thumbnails. If there are more images, the size of catalog file will grow. So be
carefull with adding big images in your catalog file!
