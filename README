pyGTKtalog 0.8
==============

pyGTKtalog Linux/FreeBSD program for indexing CD/DVD or directories on
filesystem. It is similar to gtktalog <http://www.nongnu.org/gtktalog/> or
gwhere <http://www.gwhere.org/home.php3>. There is no coincidence in name of
application, because it's ment to be replacement (in some way) for gtktalog,
which seems to be dead project for years.

FEATURES
========

- scanning for files in selected media
- generating thumbnails
- tagging files <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_%28metadata%29>

REQUIREMENTS
============

pyGTKtalog is written in python with following dependencies:

- pygtk <http://www.pygtk.org>
- pysqlite2 <http://pysqlite.org/> (unnecessary, if python 2.5 is used)
# - mx.DateTime <http://www.egenix.com>

Optional modules:

- PIL <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm> for image manipulation

- pyExcelerator <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyexcelerator> for export to
  excel capability

Additional pyGTKtalog uses EXIF module by Gene Cash which is included in 
sources.

pyGTKtalog extensivly uses external programs in unix spirit, however there is
small possibility of using it Windows (probably with liitations) and quite big
possiblity to run it on other sofisticated unix-like systems (i.e.
BeOS/ZETA/Haiku, QNX or MacOSX).

INSTALATION
===========

All you have to do is:

- put pyGTKtalog directory into your destination of choice (/usr/local/share,
  /opt or ~/ is typical choice)
- modify pyGTKtalog/pyGTKtalog line 4 to match right directory
- copy/link pyGTKtalog/pyGTKtalog shell script to /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin or in
  other place, where PATH variable is pointing or you feel like.

Then, just run pyGTKtalog script.
  
TODO

- searching database
- taggin files
