pyGTKtalog 0.8
==============

pyGTKtalog Linux/FreeBSD program for indexing CD/DVD or directories on
filesystem. It is similar to gtktalog <http://www.nongnu.org/gtktalog/> or
gwhere <http://www.gwhere.org/home.php3>. There is no coincidence in name of
application, because it's ment to be replacement (in some way) for gtktalog,
which seems to be dead project for years.

FEATURES
========

- scan for files in selected media
- get/generate thumbnails from exif and other images
- most important exif tags
- add/edit description and notes
- fetch comments for images made in gThumb <http://gthumb.sourceforge.net>
- add/remove unlimited images to any file or directory
- tagging files <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_%28metadata%29>
- and more :)

REQUIREMENTS
============

pyGTKtalog is written in python with following dependencies:

- pygtk <http://www.pygtk.org>
- pysqlite2 <http://pysqlite.org/> (unnecessary, if python 2.5 is used)

Optional modules:

- PIL <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm> for image manipulation
- pyExcelerator <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyexcelerator> for export to
  excel capability

Additional pyGTKtalog uses EXIF module by Gene Cash which is included in 
sources.

pyGTKtalog extensivly uses external programs in unix spirit, however there is
small possibility of using it Windows (probably with liitations) and quite big
possiblity to run it on other sofisticated unix-like systems (i.e.
BeOS/ZETA/Haiku, QNX or MacOSX).

INSTALATION
===========

All you have to do is:

- put pyGTKtalog directory into your destination of choice (/usr/local/share,
  /opt or ~/ is typical choice)
- modify pyGTKtalog/pyGTKtalog line 4 to match right directory
- copy/link pyGTKtalog/pyGTKtalog shell script to /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin or in
  other place, where PATH variable is pointing or you feel like.

Then, just run pyGTKtalog script.
  
TODO
====

For version 1.0 following aims have to be done:

- searching database
- tagging files (40%)
	- user definied group of tags (represented by color in cloud tag) (10%)
x file details:
	x files properties
		x thumbnail
		x description
		x edit note and description
	x exif information
	x gthumb integration
x adding images
x generating/saving thumbnails
x moving hardcoded files extensions into config
x statistics

Legend: [-] not done, [x] done.

For version 2.0:
- Icon grid in files view
- command line support: query, adding media to collection etc
- internationalization support
- export to XLS

Removed:
- filetypes handling (movies, images, archives, documents etc). Now it have
  common, unified external "plugin" system - simple text output from command
  line programs.
- anime/movie
		- title
		- alt title
		- type (anime movie, movie, anime oav, anime tv series, tv series, etc)
		- cover/images
		- genre
		- lang
		- sub lang
		- release date (from - to)
		- anidb link/imdb link
  Maybe in future versions. Now text file descriptions/notes and tags have to
  be enough for good and fast information search.
- file information (date, size, etc) (50%) (no need for?)
  
NOTES
=====

Catalog file is tared and optionaly compressed sqlite database and directories
with images and thumbnails. If there are more images, the size of catalog file
will grow. So be carefull with adding big images in your catalog file!
