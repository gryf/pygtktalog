pyGTKtalog 1.0 RC1
==============

pyGTKtalog is Linux/FreeBSD program for indexing CD/DVD or directories on
filesystem. It is similar to gtktalog <http://www.nongnu.org/gtktalog/> or
gwhere <http://www.gwhere.org/home.php3>. There is no coincidence in name of
application, because it's ment to be replacement (in some way) for gtktalog,
which seems to be dead project for years.

FEATURES
========

- scan for files in selected media
- get/generate thumbnails from exif and other images
- most important exif tags
- add/edit description and notes
- fetch comments for images made in gThumb <http://gthumb.sourceforge.net>
- add/remove unlimited images to any file or directory
- tagging files <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_%28metadata%29>
- and more :)

REQUIREMENTS
============

pyGTKtalog is written in python with following dependencies:

- python 2.4 or higher
- pygtk <http://www.pygtk.org>
- pysqlite2 <http://pysqlite.org/> (unnecessary, if python 2.5 is used)

Optional modules:

- PIL <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm> for image manipulation
- pyExcelerator <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyexcelerator> for export to
  excel capability

Additional pyGTKtalog uses EXIF module by Gene Cash which is included in 
sources and slightly updatetd to EXIF 2.2.

pyGTKtalog extensivly uses external programs in unix spirit, however there is
small possibility of using it Windows (probably with limitations) and quite big
possiblity to run it on other sofisticated unix-like systems (i.e.
BeOS/ZETA/Haiku, QNX or MacOSX).

INSTALATION
===========

All you have to do is:

- put pyGTKtalog directory into your destination of choice (/usr/local/share,
  /opt or ~/ is typical choice)
- modify pyGTKtalog/pyGTKtalog line 4 to match right directory
- copy/link pyGTKtalog/pyGTKtalog shell script to /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin or in
  other place, where PATH variable is pointing or you feel like.

Then, just run pyGTKtalog script.
  
TODO
====

PyGTKtalog is still under heavy development, however there is small chance to
change structure of catalogs (and if it'll change, there will be transparent
function to update DB schema).

For version 1.0 following major aims have to be done:

x searching database
x tagging files
	x remove nasty bug in redraw of tag cloud
x file details:
	x files properties
		x thumbnail
		x description
		x edit note and description
	x exif information
	x gthumb integration
x adding images
x generating/saving thumbnails
x moving hardcoded files extensions into config
x statistics

There are still minor aims for versions 1.x to be done:
- consolidate popup-menus with edit menu
- add popup menu for directly removing tag from tag cloud
- implement advanced search

Legend: [-] not done, [x] done.

For version 2.0:
- Icon grid in files view
- command line support: query, adding media to collection etc
- internationalization
- export to XLS
- user definied group of tags (represented by color in cloud tag)
- hiding specified files - configurable, like dot prefixed, cfg and manualy
  selected

Removed:
- filetypes handling (movies, images, archives, documents etc). Now it have
  common, unified external "plugin" system - simple text output from command
  line programs.
- anime/movie
		- title
		- alt title
		- type (anime movie, movie, anime oav, anime tv series, tv series, etc)
		- cover/images
		- genre
		- lang
		- sub lang
		- release date (from - to)
		- anidb link/imdb link
  Maybe in future versions. Now text file descriptions/notes and tags have to
  be enough for good and fast information search.
- file information (date, size, etc) (50%) (no need for?)

NOTES
=====

Catalog file is tared and optionaly compressed sqlite database and directories
with images and thumbnails. If there are more images, the size of catalog file
will grow. So be carefull with adding big images in your catalog file!
